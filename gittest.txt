    Git is version control system
    Git helps to keep track of code changes
    Git is used to collaborate on code (Multiple people can use a same code using git)
    
    U -> Untracked
    A -> Added
    M -> Modified

    
    in cmd
    -> git config --global user.name "username"
    -> git config --global user.email "email"

    -> git clone (link of repository)

    
    -> git status

    ! add to stageagrea -> add to git folder -> add to github

    1.to add file into staging area 
    -> git add text2.txt
    U change to A 
    

    2. to add file into git folder
    -> git commit -m "some messages"
    after this there is no symbol in rightside of file

    3. to move file from git folder to github
    -> git push origin(it represents the repo link) main


    create test3 file and try to pushed
    in test3 while input some text its truns in to M 


    to get changes from git to local folder
    -> git pull

    to add a new repo from local system create folder and use below commands
    -> git init 

    to add multiple files in the folder at same time
    -> git add .

    to push the new repo
    first create repo in github web
    then to connect to those
    -> git remote add origin "new repo link"

    to check name of brach (main/master)
    -> git branch

    {
        we can push by using branch name eg: if branch name is master
        -> git push origin master
    }
    or
    {
        we can change the branch name to main
        -> git branch -M main

        now branch name change to main now we can try
        -> git push origin main
    }


    to check branches in main
    -> git branch -a

    create branch in github web
    to move to another branch
    -> git checkout brachname

    to push changes to branch
    -> git push origin branchname

    to check diff between present to another branch
    -> git diff branchname

    to link the subbranch to main (go to main first)
    -> git merge branchname (after this need to push commang to get changes in web)

    to create new branch from ide
    -> git branch branchname

    if we wont own the main than we can raise pullrequest to main from github web

    Git Conflicts
    -------------

    if two branches changes same line in main that arises Conflicts we need to resolve first before commit changes

    to get changes of main to branch
    go to respective branch
    -> git pull origin main
